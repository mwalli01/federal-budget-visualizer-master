# federal-budget-visualizer-master

Hi there.

This is a visualization of the US federal budget taken from github.com/WhiteHouse/budgetdata, built in Unity engine.
Each spending account is represented as to-scale blocks of 100 dollar bills. You can(not yet) walk around and explore
various intricacies of the federal budget with a HTC Vive headset!

The initial concept was inspired by Leonard Rifas, an educational comic illustrator from Seattle, Washington.

I've been working on this on and off for the last 4 months, and it is very very very much a work in progress. I'd be appreciative of
help or advice anyone would be willing to give!

****TODO****
-more code comments
-refactor code for GameObject instatiation.
-write functions for handling comma deliminations from budgetdata csv
-write something to auto fetch most recent budget data from the whitehouse repository
-function to fix moneybox spacing issues
-search, sort, and switch between budget years
-Descriptions of accounts
-vive controller support
-design, color, movement considerations
-the todo list
